#Ingedients
* olive oil cooking spray
* 4 cups rolled oats
* 2 cups rolled rye
* 1 cup wheat bran flakes
* 1 cup wheat bran straws
* &frac12; cup pumpkin seeds
* 1 cup honey
* 2 x 200g packets Angas Park Traditional Fruit Sala

#Directions
1. Preheat oven to 180&deg;C. Lightly spray a large roasting pan with oil. Combine oats, rye, bran flakes, bran straws and pumpkin seeds. Spread evenly over base of pan.
2. Drizzle honey over oat mixture. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove pan from oven. Stir well, as muesli on top and at edges of pan toasts more quickly. Return to oven and bake for 7 minutes or until muesli is evenly toasted.
3. Using kitchen scissors, cut fruit into small, even-sized pieces. Stir into warm muesli. Set aside, uncovered, to cool completely. Spoon muesli into a large, airtight container.
