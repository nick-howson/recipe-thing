#Directions
1. Place the strips of beef, the minced garlic, the grated ginger, the chopped chillis and curry paste into a bowl and give it a good mix around.
2. Heat some oil in a pan and add the beef and stir fry until the beef is brown.
3. When its brown take the beef out and set to the side. In the same pan you did the beef in add the wedges of onion and stir-fry for about 3 minutes over a medium heat. you may need to add a bit more oil.
4. When the onions are golden add the bell peppers, corn, bamboo shoots and the water chestnuts and stir-fry for 5 minutes or until the vegtables are tender.
5. Now return the beef to the pan, stir in the fish sauce, the stock and the sugar give it a good stir and simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep an eye on the level of the stock, you want to reduce it but not too much.
