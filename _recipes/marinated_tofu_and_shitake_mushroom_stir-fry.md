#Ingedients
* 300g firm tofu, cut into thin strips
* 60ml (&frac14; cup) mirin (rice wine)
* 2 tablespoons salt-reduced soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
* 1 teaspoon caster sugar
* Vegetable oil spray
* 1 red onion, cut into thin wedges
* 150g shiitake mushrooms, halved
* 2 bunches broccolini, ends trimmed, cut into 2cm lengths
* 1 red capsicum, deseeded, thinly sliced
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
* steamed SunRice Basmati Rice, to serve

#Directions
1. Place the tofu in a shallow glass or ceramic dish. Combine half the mirin, soy sauce and ginger in a jug and pour over the tofu. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to marinate.
2. Combine the sugar and remaining mirin, soy sauce and ginger in a small bowl. Heat a wok or frying pan over high heat. Lightly spray with olive oil spray. Drain the tofu and reserve the marinade. Add one-third of the tofu to the wok and cook for 1-2 minutes each side or until golden brown. Transfer to a plate. Repeat, in 2 more batches, with the remaining tofu.
3. Lightly spray the wok with olive oil spray. Add the onion and stir-fry for 1 minute or until brown. Add the mushroom and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until tender. Add the broccolini and capsicum and stir-fry for 1 minute or until almost tender. Add the tofu, mirin mixture and reserved marinade and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until broccolini is tender crisp and the marinade comes to the boil.
4. Divide the rice among serving bowls. Top with the stir-fry and sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve.
