#Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 150&deg;C. In a large bowl combine oats, flour, sugar and coconut and mix well.
2. Combine syrup and reduced fat spread in a small saucepan and stir over a low heat until melted and runny. Add coconut essence. Combine soda and boiling water in a small bowl or cup and stir through the golden syrup mixture immediately.
3. Stir the warm wet mixture through the dry ingredients and combine well.
4. Roll two teaspoons of the mixture into small balls and place 4-5cm apart on a greased baking tray. Press down lightly on each biscuit with the back of a spoon to flatten a little. Bake for 18 minutes or until golden brown. With a spatula or bread and butter knife separate the biscuits from the tray while still warm to prevent sticking. Cool on trays.

#Tips
* If you want a chewier Anzac biscuit try lining the baking trays with baking paper first. To make rolling the biscuits easier be sure to use slightly wet hands. Biscuits can be stored for 3-4 days in an air-tight container. A teaspoon of cinnamon or ground ginger is also a good way to vary this old fashioned Aussie favourite.
* For a wheat free biscuit try substituting gluten free flour.
