#Directions
1. Cur the pork tenderloin pieces and marinate with the ingredients for 15-20 minutes.
2. Mix the weet and sour sauce ingredients well and set aside.
3. Strain the dry ingredients of the frying batter and then add in the egg, water, and cooking oil to form a thick batter.
4. When the pork is well-marinated, transfer the pork pieces into the batter and make sure they are wll coated. In a deep skillet, add in the cooking oil enough for deep-frying. Once the oil is hot, deep fry the pork pieces until they turn golden brown. Dish out and drain on paper towels.
5. Heat up a wok and add in some cooking oil. Add in the chopped garlic and stir fry until light brown, then follow by the bell pepper and pineapple pieces. Stir fry until you smell the peppery aroma from the peppers and then add in the sweet and sour sauce. As soon as the sauce thickens, transfer the pork into the wok and stir well with the sauce. Add in the chopped scallions, do a few quick stirs, dish out and serve hot with steamed white rice.
