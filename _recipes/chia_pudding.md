#Ingedients
* 1/3 cup white chia seeds
* 1.5 cups milk
* 2 tbsp maple syrup
* 1/2 tsp vanilla

#Directions
1. Combine all the ingredients in a pint jar. Cover the jar with a lid and give it a vigorous shake.
2. Chill for about an hour, then return to the jar and shake it up. Let chill for at least 4 hours and overnight is even better.
3. Chia seeds will expand and turn into pudding the consistency of applesauce (it won't get really thick).
4. Serve cold with sliced fruit or toasted nuts on top.
