#Ingedients

##Sauce

* 1 cup thick barbecue sauce
* 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
* 3-4 hot chilies for spice
* 3 tablespoons chilli powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* &frac14; teaspoon ground cinnamon

##Other

* 1 boneless pork shoulder roast, 1-1.5kg, fat trimmed
* &frac12; cup chopped cilantro (corriander leaves)

#Directions
1. Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl.
2. Place pork in crockpot. Pour sauce over the pork, lifting pork slightly so sauce will flow under the roast. Cover and cook on LOW for 8 to 10 hours, or until pork is very tender.
3. Remove pork to a cutting board and chop or shred with forks.
4. Pour sauce into a serving bowl or leave in slow cooker. Stir in cilantro and the shredded pork.
5. Serve with flour tortillas, split sandwich buns or on rice.

#Notes
* If sauce is very liquid, cook down on top the stovetop until desired thickness and flavour is reached.
