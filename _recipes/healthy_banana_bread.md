#Ingedients
* 2 cups (300g) of self raising flour
* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* Pinch of salt
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* &frac12; cup (110g) caster sugar
* 3/4 cup (125g) sultanas (or pitted date - less sugar!)
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 cup (250mL) reduced fat milk
* 1 cup mashed banana (about 2 large ripe bananas)

#Directions
1. Preheat oven to 180&deg;Celcius. Line the base and sides of a 23cmx13cm loaf pan with non-stick baking paper.
2. Sift flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and cinnamon into a large bowl. Stir in sugar and sultanas.
3. Combine eggs, milk and bananas in a large jug. Whisk with a fork, until well combined. Using a large metal spoon, stir egg mixture into dry ingredients, until well combined.
4. Pour mixture into a prepared loaf pan. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve lightly buttered, or toasted.
