#Directions
1. Preheat oven to 220&deg;C. Heat 2 large baking trays in the oven for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spray with olive oil spray. Add the onion and capsicum. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes or until soft. Increase heat to high. Add the mince. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 4-5 minutes or until the mince changes colour. Add the cumin, paprika and coriander. Cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic. Remove from heat. Stir in the currants and parsley.
3. Divide passata and mince mixture among bread. Place on the trays. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until bases are crisp.
4. Cut each pizza into quarters. Top with rocket and serve with the yoghurt.
