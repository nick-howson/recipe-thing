* 2 tsp baking powder
* &frac12; cup caster sugar
* &frac14; tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 eggs
* &#8531; cup canola oil
* 1 cup chopped dried dates

#Directions
1. Preheat oven 170&deg;C.
2. Line a 26cm x 17cm slice tray with baking paper any larger and the mix won't cover the base or line a loaf tin for a higher slice, increase cooking time by 5 minutes.
3. Place the polenta, flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl, stir to combine.
4. Whisk together the eggs and oil. Add to dry ingredients and stir to combine.
5. Divide batter in half. Using damp hands press half evenly into prepared tin. Sprinkle over the dates. Spoon over the remaining batter. (Alternatively, stir dates in with the batter).
