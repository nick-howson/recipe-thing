#Directions
1. Combine cornflour, half the soy sauce and 1 tablespoon sherry in a bowl. Add chicken and turn to coat. Heat half the peanut oil in a wok over high heat until just smoking. Cook half the chicken for 2 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat with remaining peanut oil and chicken.
2. Drain peanut oil from the wok, reserving 1 tablespoon. Heat reserved oil in the wok over high heat. Stir-fry garlic and ginger for 30 seconds or until aromatic. Add capsicum and stir-fry for 3 minutes or until tender. Add chicken, stock, cinnamon and remaining soy sauce and sherry. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 12 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is reduced. Drizzle over the sesame oil. Top with chilli and serve with rice.
