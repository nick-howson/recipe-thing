2. Wearing disposable gloves to avoid staining your hands, remove the skin and discard. Cut the beetroot into wedges. Pack beetroot into dry, sterilised jars.
3. Combine the vinegar, water, sugar, peppercorns, cloves and salt in a large saucepan over high heat. Bring to the boil. Cover and set aside to cool.
4. Cover the beetroot with the vinegar mixture and seal.
