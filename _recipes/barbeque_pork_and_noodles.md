#Ingedients
* 3 green shallots, trimmed, thinly sliced
* 60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice
* 2 (about 200g each) pork fillets, excess fat trimmed
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
* 1 x 200g pkt Chang's Egg Noodles
* 1 bunch choy sum
* 1 red capsicum, halved, deseeded, thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons Chang's Oyster Sauce
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1 cup loosely packed coriander leaves
* Chang's Oyster Sauce, extra, to serve
* Soy sauce, to serve

#Directions
1. Combine the green shallot, soy sauce, sugar, honey, garlic and five spice in a large glass or ceramic dish. Add the pork fillets and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 2 hours to develop the flavours.
2. Preheat oven to 180&deg;C. Line a baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Place pork on the prepared tray. Cook in preheated oven, basting occasionally, for 20 minutes or until golden brown and just cooked through. Remove from oven. Cover with foil and set aside for 5 minutes to rest.
3. Place the sesame seeds in a small frying pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until toasted. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Cook the noodles in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 5 minutes or until tender. Add the choy sum and cook for 30 seconds or until bright green and tender crisp. Drain well. Place in a large heatproof bowl. Add the capsicum, oyster sauce, sesame seeds and oil and gently toss to combine.
5. Thinly slice the pork across the grain. Add to the noodle mixture with the coriander leaves and toss to combine. Divide among serving bowls. Drizzle with extra oyster sauce and serve immediately with soy sauce, if desired.
