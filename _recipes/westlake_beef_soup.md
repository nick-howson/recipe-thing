#Directions
1. On modestly high heat, brown and caramelize the beef. If using ground, break up into as small chunks as you can. 
2. Add ginger and shiitakes and saute for a bit until fragrant. Add beef broth. Add water chestnuts and tofu. Bring to rapid boil. 
3. Pour in enough cornstarch slurry to thicken to a thin gravy consistency. 
4. Pour in beaten eggs in a steady stream, stirring the surface of the soup with a fork to break up the egg stream into fine ribbons of cooked egg. 
5. Add a few dashes of white pepper, the cilantro and scallions, and taste for salt. Serve.

# Tips
* For each cup of liquid you want to thicken, start with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in a small bowl. Add an equal amount of cold liquid and stir until smooth paste forms.
